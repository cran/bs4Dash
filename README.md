**This package is still work in progress.**

**I am open to any contribution. Depending on your amount of work, you will be listed as contributor or even author.**

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN (release soon)

```r
devtools::install_github("DivadNojnarg/bs4Dash")
```

## Issues

Issues are listed [here](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/bs4Dash/issues). 
At the moment it is better not to use the **bs4SidebarMenuItemList** function.
I will remove this function anyway to simplify the package.
